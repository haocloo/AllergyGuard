# Shiba 3D Model

This directory should contain the 3D model files for the Shiba dog.

## How to get the model

1. Visit [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/) and search for "Shiba" models
2. Download a free Shiba 3D model in GLTF format (the model mentioned in the tutorial is by user zixisun02)
3. Extract the files into this directory
4. Ensure there is a `scene.gltf` file directly in this folder

## Required Files

The 3D model should include:

- `scene.gltf` - The main GLTF file
- Texture files (if any)
- Other assets the model requires

## Alternative

If you're having trouble finding the specific model, you can use any dog 3D model in GLTF format. Just place it in this directory and rename the main file to `scene.gltf` if necessary.
